4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,000
>>> Welcome to Stanford CS1933P, this is winter quarter 2015

5
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,000
And we're gonna dive right in today to some brief slide work.

6
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,000
This people at Stanford, you've got a document that describe,

7
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:17,000
describes all the grading and all that stuff so

8
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I'm not gonna go over that in lecture like I often do start the quarter.

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Instead I'm gonna talk a little bit about what this class is about.

10
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,000
Brief mention of the prerequisites cuz they're pretty important in this class.

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Then just the [NOISE] quickest overview of iOS.

12
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:27,000
I'm gonna assume that anyone who is here or is watching this, knows what this is.

13
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
And then, we're gonna dive right into a big old demo.

14
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:31,000
It's gonna be a two-day thing, where I'm really going to try and

15
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:33,000
introduce you to Xcode and the development environment and

16
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:35,000
this language Swift, that you're gonna have to learn to develop for iOS.

17
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,000
All right, so what is this class about?

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:39,000
It's about building cool apps, as we know.

19
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,000
Why are these iOS apps so cool?

20
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, because the device you're gonna run them on is in your pocket or

21
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:45,000
in your backpack.

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:47,000
it's highly networked and incredible graphics with animation.

23
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:49,000
It's just cool all the way around and I think you guys all know that or

24
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,000
you wouldn't be here.

25
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:53,000
But you're also gonna learn in

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:55,000
this class a lot of real life Object-Oriented Programming.

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
You're taking a lot of other classes here at Stanford on things like graphic. and

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
networking, and databases, and maybe animation.

29
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:01,000
Things like that.

30
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,000
And we're gonna is kinda tie that all together into a real world class.

31
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,000
OK? You're gonna get to see all this stuff.

32
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,000
Now, you know, it's gonna be kind of a survey course in that,

33
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,000
I can't go too deep into networking.

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:11,000
I can't go too deep into databases.

35
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:13,000
I can't go too deep into animation, but you'll get to see it all in a really real

36
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:15,000
world environment, where people our there building apps using that technology.

37
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:17,000
For some of you who haven't seen that before that'll be a big bonus of

38
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:19,000
this class, I think.

39
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
The prerequisites of this class.

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,000
No.1 thing is you have to be a pretty strong Object-Oriented programmer.

41
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:25,000
If you're not a strong Object-Oriented programmer, and

42
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,000
you hit this class, you're probably gonna go under water, pretty quick.

43
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:29,000
OK? I'm gonna assume you know,

44
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,000
everything about Object-Oriented Programming.

45
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
iOS is a completely Object-Oriented Programming environment,

46
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:35,000
development environment,

47
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:37,000
I just don't mean I'm not just talking about the language is Object-Oriented.

48
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,000
But the entire design of it the way you use it if you're not

49
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:41,000
comfortable with things like subclassing and

50
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,000
stuff like that then you're just really gonna be behind the curve.

51
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:45,000
In iOS so at Stanford here that means CS16A and B or

52
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
CS16X, and then you know, CS107, while it's not really Object-Oriented course,

53
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:49,000
at least it's heavy duty programming course.

54
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,000
CS108 is a great Object-Oriented course so

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,000
if you have, if you've taken CS108 you'll probably, be really well prepped.

56
00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:55,000
110, again not really too much an Object-Oriented program but

57
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:57,000
good programming course cuz there's a lot of programming in this class,

58
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,000
in fact, all the work in this class is programming.

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:01,000
Your will not have, a little bit of reading the first couple of weeks just to

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:03,000
kinda learn this new language, but it's almost all programming after that all

61
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,000
the way til the end, including your final project.

62
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
So if you're not really comfortable with all these terms,

63
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
this Object-Oriented terms or if you're just not really comfortable with

64
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:11,000
writing big programs then this class will definitely be a challenge for you.

65
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:13,000
OK, so what's in iOS, what are the parts of it?

66
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:15,000
You know, it's ha, its's such a big system, it's got so much in it.

67
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:17,000
It's impossible for me to

68
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,000
like, encapsulate it into a small little summary but

69
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:21,000
I do have this slide right here that divides it into these four layers.

70
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:23,000
These four layers are approximately down near the hardware at the bottom.

71
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:25,000
Up near the user at the top.

72
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:27,000
OK?

73
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,000
So at the bottom, so

74
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
a lot of people don't realize that iOS is basically a Unix-based operating system.

75
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
OK? It's very similar shares a lot of

76
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:35,000
the core of Mac OS X.

77
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:37,000
OK?

78
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:39,000
Now, it's certainly optimized for mobile devices, which have

79
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:41,000
battery restrictions and things like that, but that is basically what it is.

80
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:43,000
And so down at that layer you've got sockets, and

81
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:45,000
you've got you know, permissions, and things like that,

82
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
that have to be near the oh you know, hardware to, to work properly.

83
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,000
But above that there's kind of an Object-Oriented layer that lets you get at

84
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:51,000
a lot of that stuff using Object-Oriented Programming.

85
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
OK?And this stuff is not UI oriented it's

86
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,000
more kind of accessing the hardware through Object-Oriented Programming or

87
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:57,000
accessing networking through Object-Oriented Programming but 

88
00:02:57,000 --> 00:02:59,000
it's a big layer there and so we will spend a fair amount of 

89
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:01,000
time in this layer because we need those primitives to build at the higher layers.

90
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:03,000
Then, there's this whole layer, which I wish we had more time to spend on.

91
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:05,000
We only get ten weeks in this whole class.

92
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:07,000
It goes by so fast, you'll be amazed, as you're probably,

93
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:09,000
used to with your Stanford courses.

94
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:11,000
But there's a whole media layer here, both for

95
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,000
static images, as you know, JPEG and things like that.

96
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:15,000
 And video both capturing video, editing video, all that.

97
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,000
Incredible audio, the frameworks on this device for 

98
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:19,000
doing 3D audio for games and all that.

99
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:21,000
I get to, unfortunately I get to very little of this layer.

100
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,000
But I'll try to let you know, that it's in there and then you'll know to go out and

101
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:25,000
seek out, if you're building a very audio intensive app or

102
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:27,000
video intensive app, you'll seek out that layer.

103
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,000
But we'll spend the vast majority of our time at the Cocoa Touch layer.

104
00:03:29,000 --> 00:03:31,000
So the Cocoa Touch layer, that's where the buttons and

105
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:33,000
sliders and things like that are it's the layer,

106
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:35,000
where you're gonna build the interactivity with your end user.

107
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:37,000
And so, that's where we probably spend 70 plus percent of 

108
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,000
our time in the Cocoa Touch layer.

109
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:41,000
And this is a very powerful layer.

110
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:43,000
You know, you've seen things like the maps app on the phone.

111
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,000
There's basically, an object that does almost the entire maps app, that you can

112
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:47,000
just drop right into your program, and now you have maps in your program.

113
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,000
Same thing with web browser.

114
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:51,000
If you wanna put web browsing in your app, it's just boom, pop an object in there,

115
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:53,000
call a couple methods and in your, on your way.

116
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:55,000
So very powerful, very high level in there's a lot going on in there and 

117
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,000
that's where we will spend most of our time, OK?

118
00:03:57,000 --> 00:03:59,000
And by the way, if you have any questions I try to glance up, so

119
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:01,000
the bright lights over there sometimes in my way,

120
00:04:01,000 --> 00:04:03,000
but shout out or you know, otherwise get my attention.

121
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,000
If you feel free to interrupt.

122
00:04:05,000 --> 00:04:07,000
Then there's the development platform itself.

123
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:09,000
OK?

124
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,000
With the tools we use to build these iOS apps.

125
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,000
What's in that?

126
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:15,000
Well, it's all pretty much now been funneled into this one

127
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,000
application called Xcode 6.

128
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:19,000
There are some little adjuncts that it calls out to but

129
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,000
Xcode 6 is everything, it's your code editor,

130
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,000
it's your compiler, your debugger all of that in one, pretty awesome app.

131
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,000
And so we'll be learning all about Xcode 6 in this class, and 

132
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
that's where you'll be spend all your time developing, you're not gonna be at

133
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,000
a terminal typing in Emacs or something, you're gonna be in Xcode 6.

134
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,000
Languages I have there's actually, two languages in iOS now.

135
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,000
There are peers that you can pretty much use either one.

136
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:35,000
One of them is called Objective-C,

137
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:37,000
that's the languages that iOS was originally developed for.

138
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:39,000
It's a language been around a long time, probably 30 years it's been around or 25

139
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:41,000
to 30 years that's it's actually been used to build stuff that's on the Mac today.

140
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:43,000
So, it's very mature language but it's also 25, 30 years old.

141
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
And so Apple last summer introduced a completely new language called Swift, and

142
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,000
Swift, you can do pretty much everything in iOS with Swift and

143
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:49,000
that's the language we're gonna learn because it's a modern language.

144
00:04:49,000 --> 00:04:51,000
Apple did a great job of kind of, building all the best stuff of

145
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,000
all the languages that have been invented over the last, you know,

146
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:55,000
25 years of this especially the last five or ten years into this language.

147
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:57,000
It's very concise it's a very type safe language but have type inference and a lot

148
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
of things that make it so that you get the best of both worlds by having type safety-

149
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,000
>>[COUGH]>>And not have to

150
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:03,000
be constantly over specifying everything.

151
00:05:03,000 --> 00:05:05,000
So we're gonna go Swift only, I'm not even gonna really talk about Objective-C,

152
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:07,000
I just don't have time to do both languages.

153
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:09,000
Yeah.>>[INAUDIBLE] This is

154
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,000
a [INAUDIBLE] course [INAUDIBLE] [COUGH] [INAUDIBLE] doing iOS development.

155
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:13,000
>> Yeah, so the question is if I'm going out into the world to do

156
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,000
iOS development in the real world for real companies.

157
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:17,000
Am I probably, gonna have to learn Objective-C?

158
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,000
And the answer is it depends on the company you're at.

159
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
Probable in the short term, yes.

160
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:23,000
But as the time goes by probably, more and more people switch to Swift.

161
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:25,000
The good thing is the underlying iOS

162
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:27,000
APIs are exactly the same for both, it's just the syntax-

163
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:29,000
of the language a little bit

164
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,000
about how the language approaches calling the API is slightly different, but any,

165
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:33,000
everything that you learn in here about the underlying,

166
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:35,000
parts of iOS will totally work in Objective-C.

167
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:37,000
All the methods are the same you know,

168
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,000
it's just the syntax is a little different.

169
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:41,000
So, don't feel too bad about not

170
00:05:41,000 --> 00:05:43,000
learning both languages, and once you've learned this language,

171
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:45,000
learning Objective-C is gonna be pretty easy, too.

172
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,000
So, Good question though.

173
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,000
All right.

174
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:51,000
Of course iOS is filled with tons of frameworks.

175
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:53,000
Frameworks are libraries, basically, of objects that you use,

176
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:55,000
as building blocks to build your application.

177
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,000
And we are going to be covering them.

178
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
UIKit is the main one.

179
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,000
It's got most of the user interface stuff in it.

180
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:03,000
Foundation is that most the course services layer that I was talking about,

181
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:05,000
and but there's tons of other ones, core motion for doing the device moving

182
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:07,000
around, you know, gyro and accelerometer, core date for Object-Oriented database.

183
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:09,000
Things like that.

184
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:11,000
So I'll get to, as many as those as I can especially the big ones.

185
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:13,000
But there's just way too many to cover in ten weeks.

186
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,000
And finally we I, I put this,

187
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:17,000
as a first class thing with all the rest, as a design strategy MVC.

188
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:19,000
I think, I usually ask, I'll all ask this year, too.

189
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:21,000
How many people have used MVC in some other class?

190
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,000
See, so it's half of you.

191
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,000
So I'll be teaching MVC, as if you don't know it, so

192
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:27,000
if you don't know it don't worry.

193
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,000
But MVC is a way of designing your application so that it's a little more

194
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
debuggable, reusable understandable to you and to anyone reading your code.

195
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,000
And iOS was designed with MVC from start.

196
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:35,000
So it's just integral part to building an iOS.

197
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:37,000
Now, I'm gonna do the demo today, and on Wednesday I'm kinda not gonna follow MVC.

198
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:39,000
But then next Monday we're gonna apply MVC to the demo I'm doing today and

199
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:41,000
Wednesday, so you're gonna get the full MVC treatment there.

200
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,000
And I'll be having some slides on MVC on Wednesday to prepare you for next Monday.

201
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,000
OK? All right, so here's the demo.
